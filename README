Explanations:
dbConfig.php = configures database structure immediately if it has access to schema.sql
schema.sql = added if not exists due to code
styles.css = css style applications
handleForms.php = if else conditions for index.php
index.php = main page
models.php = function definitions

FOLDERS USED:
main = where the main things are put in
sql = where schema is placed

Due to security reasons from my browser I had to put locations in literal URL form
